## Description
The purpose of this assignment is to practice using external APIs to call information to your page. We were to make a page that will display information about the weather from a city that can be search and it will store the information. You should also be able to delete citys from the store information on the page. This assignment is a great way to help us learn about APIs and how they work, and their usefulness.
